<h1>You Should Go Vegan</h1>
<h2>Good For The Animals</h2>
<p>The most important reason for why you should go vegan is to bring an end the harm inflicted upon animals to satiate the desires of selfish human beings. There isn't a single nutrient we need that cannot come from a plant source. Most people would agree that for something to be right and justified, it must contribute to an overall good. And for something to be wrong it must be a net detriment. Continuing to enslave animals when we know we don't need to is wrong.</p>
<h2>Good For You</h2>
<p>There are numerous health benefits associated  with a plant based diet. A plant based diet has been proven to be fit for all stages of life and even lead to the reversal of the development of cardiovascular issues and decreased risk to 12+ different types of cancers.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/the-china-study/">The China Study</a> that demonstrates that a vegan diet based on the consumption of whole food plant-based foods is the optimum diet to prolonging longevity and healthy living.</p>
<h2>Good For The World</h2>
<p>Animal agriculture, along with fishing, is ruining our planet. Animal agriculture is a massive proponent of greenhouse gasses which continue to wreck havoc on the atmosphere. Dead zones in the ocean from over-fishing are well on their way to causing the extinction of marine life. 30% of our habitable land is being set aside for the mass murder of animals. It takes significantly less land to grow crops to feed humans instead of growing to feed animals en mass.</p>
<p>If you're worried about the extinction of animals, go vegan. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969715303697">No, veganism does not cause extinction. It's carnism.</a></p>
